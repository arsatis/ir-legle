module description, aims and objectives: this module discusses the basic concepts and methods of information retrieval including capturing, representing, storing, organizing, and retrieving unstructured or loosely structured information.
the most well-known aspect of information retrieval is document retrieval: the process of indexing and retrieving text documents.
however, the field of information retrieval includes almost any type of unstructured or semi-structured data, including newswire stories, transcribed speech, email, blogs, images, or video. therefore, information retrieval is a critical aspect of web search engines.
this module also serves as the foundation for subsequent modules on the understanding, processing and retrieval of particular web media.
there is a facebook page (accessible from the fb link on the top menu) for this course across cohorts. current students and alumni are welcome to contribute news and items of potential interest to the page (i.e., ir news, job openings specific to ir).
in this homework, you will be implementing a language detection module using the ngram knowledge you learned in week 1. given a string representing some natural language utterance, your program should be able to predict whether the text is indonesian, malaysian or (phonetically transcribed into english) tamil. so given the following three strings
the python program build_test_lm.py is given to you as a skeleton script. you are required to complete this script by implementing the build_lm() and test_lm() functions.
you need to collect the 4-grams from the string where the gram units are characters. for example, for the string semua manusia dilahirkan bebas ..., the below character 4-grams would be collected (note that you can choose to pad the beginning and end of the string as shown in lecture 1; it's up to you, but you'll want to document your choice).
for each of the malaysian, indonesian and tamil labels, you then build a language model with add one smoothing, similar to the ones shown in lecture 1, which smooths out all observed ngrams. the differences are that you are required to use probabilities instead of counts and 4-grams instead of unigrams. your language models for the three labels should look in a way similar to the following table, where rows 3 to 4 are the language models for malaysian, indonesian, and tamil, respectively. note that each row should sum up to 1, and there are other entries in the table that have been omitted for clarity.
you are also encouraged to think about the following essay questions as you work on the assignment. these questions are meant to enhance your understanding of the lecture materials and the assignment. you are not required to submit your answers, but you are welcome to do so and discuss your answers with us. note that these are open-ended questions and do not have gold standard answers. a paragraph or two are usually sufficient for each question. it would be even better if you can support your answers with experimental results.
